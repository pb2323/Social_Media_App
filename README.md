# What is this?
A social networking platform for freelancers where:

* Users will be able to post pictures, status, like, and comment on pictures.

* Users can follow/follow back/unfollow other users to see the content they post. IPFS is used to store the content users post.

* Users can send text messages in real-time, and perform audio/video calls.

* Receive notifications of activities in their profile.

* Create a smart contract that requires the client to stake the freelancer's fees, and the freelancer to stake half of the amount the client staked. This amount will be stored in the smart contract as a guarantee from both parties until the project is completed. The funds can be transferred either partly or in full. The freelancer can request a transfer, which the client can approve, and the assets will be transferred accordingly. The client cannot request a transfer, and the freelancer cannot approve any transfer requests. (Metamask extension is mandatory to use this feature)

* Furthermore, in case of a dispute between the client and the freelancer that cannot be resolved by mutual agreement, the client may choose a guarantor with whom they have mutually agreed. The guarantor will have the authority to raise and approve requests and make the final decision to resolve the conflict.

* Supporting two major blockchains currently: a) Ethereum b) Polygon

Update: Ethereum Rinkeby test network is deprecated on October 2022 and only polygon test network is supported currently

# Tech Stack

The whole project is created using Javascript language. Particularly for the backend, NodeJS + Express framework is used and for the frontend, NextJS is used. MongoDB is used as a database. SocketIO is used for real-time messaging and WebRTC is for video/audio call purposes. Solidity language is used to create smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.

# Future Work

* Gas optimizations to reduce the gas fee that users have to pay to interact with the blockchain.

* Client rating feature through which clients can better identify reliable freelancers. 

* We can shift the centralized chatting system to a decentralized network.

* We can use our contract feature in a Saas model and can integrate it into existing centralized platforms/competitors and charge them for every contract created or a percentage or ether staked.
