# What is this?
A social media platform for freelancers where:

* Users will be able to post pictures, status, like, and comment on pictures.

* Users can follow/follow back/unfollow other users to see the content they post. IPFS is used to store the content users post.

* Users can send text messages in real-time, perform audio/video calls.

* Receive notifications of activities in their profile.

* Create a smart contract where the client has to stake freelancerâ€™s fees and the freelancer has to stake half of the amount client staked, which will be stored in the smart contract, until the project is done, as a guarantee from both the parties. Funds can also be transferred partly/fully, the freelancer can add a request for transfer (disabled for client) which has to be approved by the client(disabled for freelancer) for transfer of the assets.

* In addition to this, if there is a conflict between the client and the freelancer, and none of them agrees to a settlement, the client can nominate a guarantor, based on their mutual discussion, who has the ability for both, creating a request as well as approving it, who can decide the final conclusion for the conflict.

* Supporting two major blockchains currently: a) Ethereum b) Polygon

# Tech Stack

The whole project is created using Javascript language. Particularly for the backend, NodeJS + Express framework is used and for the frontend, NextJS is used. MongoDB is used as a database. SocketIO is used for real-time messaging and WebRTC for video/audio call purposes. Solidity language is used to create smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.

# Future Work

* Gas optimizations to reduce the gas fee that users have to pay to interact with the blockchain.

* Client rating feature through which clients can better identify reliable freelancers. 

* We can shift the centralized chatting system to a decentralized network.

* We can use our contract feature in a Saas model and can integrate it to existing centralized platform/competitors and charge them for every contract created or a percentage or ether staked.
